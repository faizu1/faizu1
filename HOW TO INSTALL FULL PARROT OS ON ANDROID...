Hello friends, In in today's article I will show you how to install Parrot Os on Android without having root access.
What is parrotOs 
ParrotOs is a debian based Linux distro made for Hacking and pentesting. It can be an alternative to Kali Linux.
Prerequisite :
Termux
Vnc Application
Installation :
The First thing we have to do is to make sure our repositories are up to date, to do that type the command
pkg update
it is essential to install proot-distro and wget as we will be installing parrotOs on proot-distro for easy installation and we will be using the wget command to get the parrot file from its source 
pkg install wget proot-distro
After that we need to add ParrotOs rootfs to proot-distro list, to do that follow the guidelines below
nano $PREFIX/etc/proot-distro/parrot.sh

distro_setup() {

        # Don't update gvfs-daemons and udisks2

        run_proot_cmd apt-mark hold gvfs-daemons udisks2

}

and save the file. 
Type ctrl + O to save & Ctrl + x to exit
Now install ParrotOs
proot-distro install parrot
After installation you can always login to parrot using the command 
proot-distro login parrot

Now that you're logged in to parrot, update your Terminal with the command
apt update
Now install sudo and the nano text Editor so that we can use the sudo permission in case we create a user account and the nano text Editor for modifying scripts. do that with the command
apt install sudo nano
Now install xfce GUI with the command
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-terminal xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin -y
Now we install a browser and some dependencies with the command
sudo apt install firefox-esr dbus-x11 neofetch -y
Once this has been completed, create a connection shortcut with the command below;
echo "DISPLAY=:1 dbus-launch xfce4-session" >> /usr/local/bin/startserver ; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/startserver
Now open a new Terminal to Termux and Install the required Packages to connect to vnc, do them with these commands

pkg install x11-repo -y
Then install vncserver and Xserver with the command

pkg install tigervnc xorg-xhost
Now we create a local server and make it public with the command below

vncserver -geometry 1600x700 -listen tcp :1 ; DISPLAY=:1 xhost +
Note vnc geometry depends on the screen resolution of your Android phone.

Now switch back to your parrotOs Terminal and connect to the local server you just created with the command
startserver
Now You can open Your vnc Application and connect To the localhost:1 and your xfce4 GUI interface should be displaying.

Don't forget to always kill the vnc connection after you're done using your OS with the command

vncserver -kill :1
